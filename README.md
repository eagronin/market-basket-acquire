# Data Acquisition

## Overview
This section describes the data from a UK-based online retailer which are used in the subsequent sections to discover co-occurrence relationships among customersâ€™ purchase activities. This analysis is called market basket analysis or association analysis.  It is commonly used in marketing to increase the chance of cross-selling, provide recommendations to customers based, for example, on their browsing history and deliver targeted marketing (e.g., offer coupons to customers for products that are frequently purchased together with items that the customers recently bought).

Data exploration and cleaning are discussed in the [next section](https://eagronin.github.io/market-basket-prepare/).

The analysis for this project was performed in R.

## Description of the Online Retail Dataset
The dataset was downloaded from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail).  It is a transactional data set that contains 541909 purchases representing all the transactions that occured between December 1, 2010 and December 9, 2011 for a UK-based online retailer.  The customers of this online retailer are mainly wholesalers.  The retailer mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts.

rm(list = ls())

# read retail data item by item and create additional features
items = read.csv("Online Retail.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
```
